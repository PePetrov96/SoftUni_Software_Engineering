## Task 1. Recursive Array Sum

Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in an integer array. Use recursion.

Note: In practice, recursion should not be used here (instead, use an iterative solution), this is just an exercise.



## Task 2. Recursive Factorial

Write a program that finds the factorial of a given number. Use recursion.

Note: In practice, recursion should not be used here. Instead, you should use an iterative solution. This type of solution is for exercise purposes.



## Task 3. Sum of Coins*

Write a program that gathers a sum of money using the least possible number of coins. This is the range of possible coin values:

Â· { 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 }

You will receive the desired sum. The goal is to reach the sum using as few coins as possible using a greedy approach. We'll assume that each coin value and the desired sum are integers. There is a skeleton, which you can download from Judge. Use the Main class in the skeleton.



## Task 4. Set Cover*

Write a program that finds the smallest subset of sets, which contains all elements from a given sequence.

In the Set Cover Problem, we are given two sets - a set of sets (we'll call it sets) and a universe (a sequence). The sets contain all elements from the universe and no others, however, some elements are repeated. The task is to find the smallest subset of sets that contains all elements in the universe. Use the Main class from your skeleton.



## Task 5. Merge Sort*

Sort an array of elements using the famous merge sort.
Create your mergeSort method in the Main class.


## Task 6. Sorting*

Sort an array of elements using the famous quicksort.



## Task 7. Searching*

Implement an algorithm that finds the index of an element in a sorted array of integers in logarithmic time
