## Task 1. Sum Lines

Write a program that reads a text file ("input.txt" from the Resources - Exercises) and prints on the console the sum of the ASCII symbols of each of its lines. Use BufferedReader in combination with FileReader.



## Task 2. Sum Bytes

Write a program that reads a text file ("input.txt" from the Resources - Exercises) and prints on the console the sum of the ASCII symbols of all characters inside the file. Use BufferedReader in combination with FileReader.



## Task 3. ALL CAPITALS!

Write a program that reads a text file ("input.txt" from the Resources - Exercises) and changes the casing of all letters to the upper. Write the output to another file ("output.txt").



## Task 4. Count Character Types

Write a program that reads a list of words from the file ("input.txt" from the Resources - Exercises) and finds the count of vowels, other symbols, and punctuation marks. Assume that:
- a, e, i, o, u are vowels, only lower case.
- All others are other symbols.
- Punctuation marks are (! , . ?).
- Do not count whitespace.

Write the results to another file – "output.txt".



## Task 5. Line Numbers

Write a program that reads a text file ("inputLineNumbers.txt" from the Resources - Exercises) and inserts line numbers in front of each of its lines. The result should be written to another text file – "output.txt".



## Task 6. Word Count

Write a program that reads a list of words from the file "words.txt" (from the Resources - Exercises) and finds how many times each of the words is contained in another file "text.txt" (from the Resources - Exercises). Matching should be case-insensitive.

Write the results in the file "results.txt". Sort the words by frequency in descending order.



## Task 7. Merge Two Files

Write a program that reads the contents of two text files ("inputOne.txt", "inputTwo.txt" from Resources - Exercises) and merges them into a third one.



## Task 8. Get Folder Size

Write a program that traverses a folder and calculates its size in bytes. Use Folder Exercises Resources in Resources.
