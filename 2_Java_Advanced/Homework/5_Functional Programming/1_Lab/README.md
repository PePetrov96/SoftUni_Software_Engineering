## Task 1.	Sort Even Numbers
Write a program that reads one line of Integers separated by ", ". 
- Print the even numbers.
- Sort them in ascending order. 
- Print them again.
Use 2 Lambda Expresions to do so.



## Task 2.	Sum Numbers
Write a program that reads one line of Integers separated by ", ". Print the count of the numbers and their sum.
Use a Function<String, Integer>.


	
## Task 3.	Count Uppercase Words
Write a program that reads one line of text from the console. Print the count of words that start with an Uppercase letter, after that print all these words in the same order as you found them in the text.

- Condition - "younger" or "older"
- Age - Integer
- Format - "name", "age" or "name age"
Depending on the condition, print the pairs in the right format.
Don't use any built-in functionality. Write your methods.



## Task 6.	Find Evens or Odds
You are given a lower and an upper bound for a range of integer numbers. Then a command specifies if you need to list all even or odd numbers in the given range. Use predicates that need to be passed to a method.
