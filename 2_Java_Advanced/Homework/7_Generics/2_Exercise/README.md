## Task 1. Generic Box

Create a generic class Box that can store any type. Override the toString() method to print the type and the value of the stored data in the format "{class full name}: {value}".

Use the class that you've created and test it with the class java.lang.String. On the first line, you will get n - the number of strings to read from the console. On the next n lines, you will get the actual strings. For each of them, create a box and call its toString() method to print its data on the console.



## Task 2. Generic Box of Integer

Use the description of the previous problem but now, test your generic box with Integers.



## Task 3. Generic Swap Method Strings

Create a generic method that receives a list containing any type of data and swaps the elements at two given indexes.

As in the previous problems, read n number of boxes of type String and add them to the list. On the next line, however, you will receive a swap command consisting of two indexes. Use the method you've created to swap the elements corresponding to the given indexes and print each element in the list.



## Task 4. Generic Swap Method Integers

Use the description of the previous problem but now, test your list of generic boxes with Integers.



## Task 5. Generic Count Method Strings

Create a method that receives as an argument a list of any type that can be compared and an element of the given type. The method should return the count of elements that are greater than the value of the given element. Modify your Box class to support comparing by the value of the data stored.

On the first line, you will receive n - the number of elements to add to the list. On the next n lines, you will receive the actual elements. On the last line, you will get the value of the element to which you need to compare every element in the list.



## Task 6. Generic Count Method Doubles

Use the description of the previous problem but now, test your list of generic boxes with Doubles.



## Task 7. Custom List

Create a generic data structure that can store any type that can be compared. Implement functions:
- void add(T element)
- T remove(int index)
- boolean contains(T element)
- void swap(int index, int index)
- int countGreaterThan(T element)
- T getMax()
- T getMin()

Create a command interpreter that reads commands and modifies the custom list that you have created. Implement the commands:
- Add {element} - Adds the given element to the end of the list.
- Remove {index} - Removes the element at the given index.
- Contains {element} - Prints if the list contains the given element (true or false).
- Swap {index1} {index2} - Swaps the elements at the given indexes.
- Greater {element} - Counts the elements that are greater than the given element and prints their count
- Max - Prints the maximum element in the list.
- Min - Prints the minimum element in the list.
- Print - Prints all elements in the list, each on a separate line.
- END - stops the reading of commands.

Note: For the Judge tests, use String as T.



## Task 8. Custom List Sorter

Extend the previous problem by creating an additional Sorter class. It should have a single static method sort() which can sort objects of type CustomList containing any type that can be compared. Extend the command list to support one additional command Sort:
- Sort - Sort the elements in the list in ascending order.



## Task 9. *Custom List Iterator

For the print command, you have probably used a for a loop. Extend your custom list class by making it implement Iterable. This should allow you to iterate your list in a foreach statement.



## Task X10. *Tuple

There is something really annoying in the C# - language. It is called a Tuple. It is a class that contains two objects. The first one is item1, and the second one is item2. It is kind of like a Map.Entry except - it simply has items that are neither key nor value. The annoyance comes from the fact that you have no idea what these objects hold. The class name is telling you nothing, the methods which it has â€“ too. So let's say we could try to implement it in Java, just for practicing generics.

Create a class Tuple, which is holding two objects. As we said, the first one will be an item1, and the second one - an item2. The tricky part here is to make the class hold generics. This means that when you create a new object of class - Tuple, there should be a way to explicitly specify both the items type separately.



## Task 11. *Threeuple

Now you are aware of a Class, which is probably a bad practice to use. Anyway, it is a nice example of using generics. Our next task is to create another Tuple. This time, our task is harder.

Create a Class Threeuple. Its name tells us that it will no longer hold just a pair of objects. The task is simple, our Threeuple should hold three objects. Make it have getters and setters. You can even extend the previous class.
