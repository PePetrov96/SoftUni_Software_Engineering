## Task 1. Exchange Integers
Read two integer numbers and, after that, exchange their values. Print the variable values before and after the exchange, as shown below:



## Task 2.	Prime Number Checker
Write a program to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1, not a product of two smaller natural numbers. For example, the only ways of writing 5 as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.
The input comes as an integer number.
The output should be True if the number is prime and False otherwise.



## Task 3.	Decrypting Messages
On the first line, you will receive a key (integer). On the second line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow. On the next n lines – you will receive a lower and an uppercase letter per line.
You should add the key to each of the characters and append them to a message. In the end, print the decrypted message. 



## Task 4.	Balanced Brackets
On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow. On the following n lines, you will receive one of the following:
 - Opening bracket – "(",
 - Closing bracket – ")" or
 - Random string
Your task is to find out if the brackets are balanced. That means after every opening bracket should follow a closing one. Nested parentheses are not valid, and if, for example, two consecutive opening brackets exist, the expression should be marked as unbalanced. You should print "BALANCED" if the parentheses are balanced and "UNBALANCED" otherwise.
