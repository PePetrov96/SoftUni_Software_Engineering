## Task 1. Sign of Integer

Create a method that prints the sign of an integer number.



## Task 2. Grades

Write a method that **receives a grade** between **2.00** and **6.00** and **prints the corresponding grade in words**:
- 2.00 – 2.99 - **"Fail"**
- 3.00 – 3.49 - **"Poor"**
- 3.50 – 4.49 - **"Good"**

Input: 3
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2
1



## Task 4. Calculations

Write a program that receives a string on the first line **("add", "multiply", "subtract", "divide")** and on the next two lines receives **two** numbers. Create four methods (for each calculation) and invoke the right one depending on the command. The method should also print the result (needs to be void).



## Task 5. Orders

Write a method that calculates the total price of an order and prints it on the console. The method should receive **one of the following** products: coffee, water, coke, snacks; and a **quantity** of the product. The prices for a single piece of each product are:
