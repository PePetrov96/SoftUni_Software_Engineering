## Task 1. Smallest of Three Numbers

Write a method to print the smallest of three integer numbers. Use an appropriate name for the method.



## Task 2. Vowels Count

Write a method that receives a single string and prints the count of the vowels. Use an appropriate name for the method.



## Task 3. Characters in Range

Write a method that receives two characters and prints on a single line all the characters in between them according to ASCII.



## Task 4. Password Validator

Write a program that checks if a given password is valid. Password rules are:
- 6 – 10 characters **(inclusive)**;
- Consists only of **letters** and **digits**;
- Have at least **2** digits.

If a password is valid, print **"Password is valid"**. If it is not valid, for every unfulfilled rule print a message:
- **"Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"**
- **"Password must consist only of letters and digits"**
- **"Password must have at least 2 digits"**



## Task 5. Add and Subtract

You will receive **3 integers**. Write a method **"Sum"** to get the sum of the first two integers. The write a method **"Subtract"** that subtracts the third integer from the result of the **"Sum"** method.



## Task 6. Middle Characters

You will receive a single string. Write a method that prints the middle character. If the length of the string is even, there are two middle characters.



## Task 7. NxN Matrix

Write a method that receives a single integer n and prints **nxn** matrix with that number.



## Task 8. Factorial Division 

Read two integer numbers. Calculate the factorial of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the second decimal point.



## Task 9. Palindrome Integers

A **palindrome** is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a program that reads a positive integer number until you receive **"END"**. For each numbered print whether the number is palindrome or not.



## Task 10. Top Number

Read an **integer** n from the console. Find all top numbers in the range **[1 … n]** and print them. A top number holds the following properties:
- Its **sum of digits is divisible by 8**, e.g. 8, 16, 88.
- Holds at least one **odd digit**, e.g. 232, 707, 87578.
